This project is based on finding a solution where in we can predict if a particular employee is likely to leave the organisation. The project was devised by collecting data on factors such as age, experience, past performance review score, educational qualifications, home town. 

This is part of the INSAID capstone project to help HR advisories to help organisations with planning their human capital needs. An early prediction model helps employees to take various steps to arrest the attrition which can be either to retain the employee or start sourcing for new employees in advance.
